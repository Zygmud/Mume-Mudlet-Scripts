##💬 Note: All scripts are written using temporary code, stored in mudlet.storage and will not show up in your mudlet triggers/aliases/keys/... I really hate clutter. Info on scripts shows up when script loads in echoes. **

## 🗂️ File Descriptions

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `AutoAssist.mpackage` | Autoassist. Follow sets leader, when anything happens to leader in combat, assists. F1 turns it on and off. (BUGGED: Regexes don't capture all combat messages)|
| `AzraZaira.mpackage` | Sets 'azra' alias after looking at the star map. Type azra to execute correct commands to open door. |
| `BlindSequence.mpackage` | Blinds targets in sequence, forward or backwards. Tired of blinding 23.spirit? This helps. |
| `FriendTracker.mpackage` | Who's who of the mume world. Ties characters to a nickname, then shows that nickname in who/group, if a friend is playing a character. Can also show the entire DB. Loads a file called "friend_char_list.json" in your mume profile folder in mudlet. Either put existing database there, or start from scratch |
| `MassEnchanting.mpackage` | Enchant arrows, bolts, whatever. Bulk enchanting. Go afk, but don't forget to feed yourself. |
| `MumeKeySubstitutions.mpackage` | Labels for keys. |
| `OldschoolTwiddlers.mpackage` | New twiddlers suck! This returns oldschool twiddlers and adds execution time. |
| `StatusBar_SpellTimers.mpackage` | Addon for Khazdul's spelltimer package, found here: https://github.com/Khazdul/MUME. It uses his timer database to put a simple bar at the bottom that shows the time, for better viewing. Also FLASHES BRIGHT RED if your big spells drop. |
| `TPTracker.mpackage` | GMCP TP tracker. Shows TP when you gain them ingame. Manual command included to check since last request. |
| `XPTracker.mpackage` | GMCP XP tracker. Gives pretty overview of what xp you gained this session. More of the data can be shown if wanted. WILL NOT WORK IF INSTALLED MIDSESSION (or will only start working next true login). REQUIRES GMCP INFO THAT IS ONLY PASSED AT LOGIN. INSTALL FIRST, THEN LOGIN TO MUME.|
