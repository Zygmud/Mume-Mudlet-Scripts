If I get hurt, there is no shame in fleeing. Set a wimpy, the old warrior said - is that a state of being I wonder? Whatever he meant, it sounded important. 3. A dented blade deals little damage. I'll have to find myself a whetstone to whet my blades and keep a keen edge on them. 4. My armour, though, I can't mend that myself! I'll have to drop by a smith to help me mend those. 5. Best learn how to tend to a wound, the ranger said. Practice bandaging with me was his advice. Even though I have no desire to become a doctor, I guess being able to at least stop the bleeding is wise.",

If I remember to bring a pan I can cook meat in it. Cooked meat always lasts longer than raw. Besides, I don't really want raw meat - yuck! And if I cook with salt, even better.

You realise that this wand is owned by Barinak.",

The surface is surprisingly smooth for an item made of copper, and its inside edges are rounded as to not chafe against the skin of the wearer. The only embellishment on the bracelet is a series of archaic runes going full circle around the outside, in line with the centre of the band.
