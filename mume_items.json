Hunting deer or even something smaller like a rabbit is a great way to renew my food supply. Just as long as I keep a knife handy for the butchering. 4. If I remember to bring a pan I can cook meat in it. Cooked meat always lasts longer than raw. Besides, I don't really want raw meat - yuck! And if I cook with salt, even better.

The only embellishment on the bracelet is a series of archaic runes going full circle around the outside, in line with the centre of the band. The meaning of the inscription is probably lost; however, the runes themselves glow with a faint, barely discernible golden light, revealing that this item may yet possess magical properties.",
